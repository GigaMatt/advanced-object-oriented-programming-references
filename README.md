# Sudoku
Utilizing Object-oriented programming aspects including encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism, Sudoku contains a GUI interface, with a network component, all built in Java. The goal of the game is to allow a human to play a game of Sudoku with a machine that understands the rules of the game.

Sudoku is a final project by Anthony Ayo, Matthew Montoya, Anthony Moran, and Enrique Salcido for UTEPâ€™s Advanced Object-Oriented Programming, CS 3331.
